# BaSP - Week 2
In this part of the project I had to create a HTML file, whose content is the same as the landing page of "Trackgenix", made the last week on Figma.

The main goal is to practice the adquired knowledge of semantic HTML and the correct use of Git and Github.

## Part of the landing page
